## Four pillars of OOP

### 1. Abstraction

####The practice of showing only essential features of an 
####application and hiding the details.

####IE: You only see the buttons of a emote control. You don't see the inner workings.

####In terms of "Class", this means combining functions and methods so that the least amount of input is required from the user.

### 2. Inheritance

####A way of reusing code through "classes".
####The two classes are the "Base Class" and the "Derived Class".
####A derived class can use all the functions which are defined in the base class.

####Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to ####derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

### 3. Encapsulation

####A trait of "Class". Functions, variables, methods, etc. are encapsulated in classes.

####Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts: abstraction focuses on the observable behavior of an object... encapsulation focuses upon the implementation that gives rise to this behavior... encapsulation is most often achieved through information hiding, which is the process of hiding all of the secrets of object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics.

### 4. Ploymorphism

####Allows the dedifining or repurposing of functions, so that they can handle many types and quantities of arguments.

####objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface.
